# MBFair: A Model-based Verification Methodology for Detecting Violations of Individual Fairness

In this file, we present the artifact used in our paper. The submission includes:
* the *UMLfair profile*.

* The MBFair tool.

* The UML models of three case studies namely, the Bank Management System based on the description of a decision-making process in a [banking system] (https://www.hypovereinsbank.de/hvb/privatkunden/services-und-marktinformationen/kundenprogramm-valyou), the Delivery Management System based on the incedent describtion of [Amazon's delivery-free service](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/), and the Loan Management System based on [business process model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92901-9_19) from an [event log](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2012:challenge) recording the loan management process of a Dutch financial institute.
