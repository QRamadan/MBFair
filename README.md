# MBFair: A Model-based Verification Methodology for Detecting Violations of Individual Fairness

In this file, we present the artifact used in our paper. The submission includes:
* the *UMLfair profile*.

* The MBFair tool.

* The inputs and the outputs of applying our proposed framework on three case studies namely, the School Management System based on an artificail case study, the Delivery Management System based on the incedent describtion of [Amazon's delivery-free service](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/), and the Loan Management System based on [business process model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92901-9_19) from an [event log](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2012:challenge) recording the loan management process of a Dutch financial institute.
