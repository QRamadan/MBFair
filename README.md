# Analyzing Individual Fairness Based on System Models

In this file, we present the artifact used in our paper. The submission includes our proposed UMLfair profile and three UML models annotated with the UMLfair profile. The UML models represent three systems namely, the School Management System based on an artificail case study, the Delivery Management System based on the incedent describtion of [Amazon's delivery-free service](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/), and the Loan Management System based on [business process model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92901-9_19) from an [event log](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2012:challenge) recording the loan management process of a Dutch financial institute. 

In addition to the UML models, we provide a data table that represents the source of the data for each system model. The data tables of the school and the delivery systems are contains artificial data while the data table of the loan management system is derived from the Statlog German Credit [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)).
